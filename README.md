# Castline

![Castline Banner](assets/castline_banner.png)

**Castline** is a minimalist 2.5D raycasting game built in C++ using SDL2 and CMake, inspired by early FPS classics like *Wolfenstein 3D*. It combines retro-style rendering with a modern C++ architecture, and serves as both a learning experience and portfolio piece.

## About This Project

This game is part of my personal portfolio and serves as a demonstration of my:

- Low-level programming and systems design skills
- Understanding of classic rendering techniques like raycasting
- Clean code structure and build system management with CMake

It is being developed with the goal of applying for a **programming internship at Guerrilla Games**.
